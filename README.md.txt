Step 1:Installation of the apache server 

Browser -> install the apache tomcat webserver installaer -> change the ports and config -> Add the server to the place were JRE is available 

Note : Make sure that you also add manager_script in the roles during the installation process so that we can use the tomcat server through the eclipse /netbeans

ApacheTomcat installed directory -> config -> server.xml (contains the server port and all other details we can change the port in here)
